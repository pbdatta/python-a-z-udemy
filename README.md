# Python-A-Z
Python code from the Udemy course Python A-Z by Kirill Eremenko &amp; Hadelin de Ponteves.
This repository will include Homework assignments from the course to display what I've learned in this class.
These are the final versions which I was able to complete on my own, if you look through them you will see
that they are described in fill-in-the-blank format. The reason is that I would begin assignments by working
on them with what ability I had, and then to be considerate of my current time and Python ability I would
switch over to the fill-in-the-blank templates. This turned out to be a viable solution, due to some of the
answers being beyond my skill and capability despite having taken notes throughout the course. However, I do
believe that these assignments showed to me the value of Python as a powerful language in the field of Data Science.
